# ðŸ‘½ Space Invaders
Space Invaders is a clone of popular arcade game with same name.
I created this game by following the "Pygame Tutorial for Beginner" 
put up by freeCodeCamp.org. The reason was to improve my python skills.

## ðŸš€ Introduction
> In Space Invader, the player controls a ship that appears at
the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the
spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens randomly fills the 
sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and
destroys the aliens. If the player shoots an aliens, a new one appears,
If any alien hits the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, 
the player loses a ship and the game ends.
